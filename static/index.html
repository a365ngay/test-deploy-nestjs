        <ol>
          <li>
            Devices and Accounts. Use of the Service may require compatible devices, Internet access, and certain
            software (fees may apply); may require periodic updates; and may be affected by the performance of these
            factors. Diginex reserves the right to limit the number of accounts that may be created from a device and
            the number of devices associated with an account. The latest version of required software may be required
            for certain transactions or features. You agree that meeting these requirements is your responsibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            Limitations on Use.  You agree to use the Service only for purposes permitted by this Agreement, and only to
            the extent permitted by any applicable law, regulation, or generally accepted practice in the applicable
            jurisdiction. If your use of the Service or other behavior intentionally or unintentionally threatens
            Diginex's ability to provide the Service or other systems, Diginex shall be entitled to take all reasonable
            steps to protect the Service and Diginex's systems, which may include suspension of your access to the
            Service. Repeated violations of the limitations may result in termination of your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            Availability of the Service. The Service, or any feature or part thereof, may not be available at all times,
            at any time or in all countries and Diginex makes no representation that the Service, or any feature or part
            thereof, is appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to access
            and use the Service, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable
            laws.
          </li>
          <li>
            Changing the Service.  Diginex reserves the right at any time to modify this Agreement and to impose new or
            additional terms or conditions on your use of the Service. In the event that Diginex does make material
            adverse changes to the Service or terms of use, you will have the right to terminate this Agreement and your
            account. Diginex shall not be liable to you for any modifications to the Service or terms of service made in
            accordance with this Section.

            care, Diginex shall not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorized use of your account
            resulting from you not following these rules. You agree to provide accurate and complete information when
            you register with, the Service and you agree to update your service registration data (the "Date") to keep

            Service.
          </li>

            OR ACCESS THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO INADVERTENT DAMAGE, CORRUPTION, LOSS, OR REMOVAL IN

            such as data files, device characteristics, written text, software, music, graphics, photographs, images,

            control the Content posted via the Service, nor does it guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such
            Content. You understand and agree that your use of the Service and any Content is solely at your own risk.

            written government authorization, including, but not limited to, certain types of encryption software and
            source code, without first obtaining that authorization. This assurance and commitment shall survive
            termination of this Agreement.

            Voluntary Termination by You. You may delete your ID and/or stop using the Service at any time. If you
            terminate your account and delete your ID, this action may be non-reversible. Termination of your account
            shall not relieve you of any obligation to pay any accrued fees or charges.
          </li>
          <li>
            Termination by Diginex. Diginex may at any time, under certain circumstances and without prior notice,
            immediately terminate or suspend all or a portion of your account and/or access to the Service. Cause for
            such termination shall include: (a) violations of this Agreement or any other policies or guidelines that
            are referenced herein and/or posted on the Service; (b) a request by you to cancel or terminate your
            account; (c) a request and/or order from law enforcement, a judicial body, or other government agency; (d)
            where provision of the Service to you is or may become unlawful; (e) unexpected technical or security issues
            or problems; (f) your participation in fraudulent or illegal activities; or (g) failure to pay any fees owed
            by you in relation to the Service, provided that in the case of non-material breach, Diginex will be
            permitted to terminate only after giving you 50 days' notice and only if you have not cured the breach
            within such 50-day period. Any such termination or suspension shall be made by Diginex in its sole
            discretion and Diginex will not be responsible to you or any third party for any damages that may result or
            arise out of such termination or suspension of your account and/or access to the Service. In addition,
            Diginex may terminate your account upon 7 days' prior notice via email to the address associated with your
            account if (a) your account has been inactive for six (6) monthes; or (b) there is a general discontinuance
            of the Service or any part thereof. Notice of general discontinuance of service will be provided as set
            forth herein, unless it would not be reasonable to do so due to circumstances arising from legal,
            regulatory, or governmental action; to address user security, user privacy, or technical integrity concerns;
            to avoid service disruptions to other users; or due to a natural disaster, a catastrophic event, war, or
            other similar occurrence outside of Diginex's reasonable control. Diginex shall not be liable to you for any
            modifications to the Service or terms of service in accordance with this Section.
          </li>
          <li>
            Effects of Termination. Upon termination of your account you may lose all access to the Service and any
            portions thereof, including, but not limited to, your account and Content. In addition, Diginex will delete
            information and data stored in or as a part of your account(s). Any individual components of the Service
            that you may have used subject to separate software license agreements will also be terminated in accordance
            with those license agreements.
